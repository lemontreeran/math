# Fermat's Little Theorem
* If p is a prime number and a is a natural number, then
###### (1) a^p=a (mod p). 	
* Furthermore, if p does not divide a, then there exists some smallest exponent d such that
###### (2) a^d-1=0 (mod p) 	
* and d divides p-1. Hence,
###### (3) a^(p-1)-1=0 (mod p). 	
* The theorem is sometimes also simply known as "Fermat's theorem" (Hardy and Wright 1979, p. 63).
