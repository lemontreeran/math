# Fermat's Little Theorem
###### If p is a prime number and a is a natural number, then
 * a^p=a (mod p). 	
###### Furthermore, if p does not divide a, then there exists some smallest exponent d such that
 * a^d-1=0 (mod p) 	
###### and d divides p-1. Hence,
 * a^(p-1)-1=0 (mod p). 	
###### The theorem is sometimes also simply known as "Fermat's theorem" (Hardy and Wright 1979, p. 63).
